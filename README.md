# 🛋️ Random Friends Episode Picker

## The One Where You Can't Decide What to Watch

Could this **BE** any more useful? A 90s-aesthetic web app that randomly picks a Friends episode for you. Perfect for when you're stuck in decision paralysis between "The One with the Embryos" and literally any other episode.

## 🎨 Features

- **All 236 episodes** from all 10 seasons (yes, we counted)
- **90s aesthetic** that'll make you nostalgic for dial-up internet
- **Friends-themed colors** - purple and orange, just like the logo
- **Comic Neue font** from Google Fonts (because Comic Sans is a lifestyle)
- **Zero dependencies** - just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Instant gratification** - click a button, get an episode

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click the big orange button
3. Watch the episode it tells you to watch
4. Repeat when you need another fix

That's it. We're not Ross explaining paleontology here - it's simple!

## 📁 What's Inside

```
├── index.html      # The main page
├── styles.css      # 90s glory in CSS form
├── episodes.js     # All 236 episodes (we really did count)
└── app.js          # The random picker logic
```

## 🎭 Why Does This Exist?

Because sometimes you need the universe to decide whether you should rewatch "The One Where Everybody Finds Out" for the 47th time or finally give "The One with the Chicken Pox" another chance.

## 🤖 Built With

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Comic Neue font (the classier Comic Sans cousin)
- Way too much nostalgia
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (who may or may not have strong opinions about Chandler's character development)

## 📺 Fun Facts

- There are 236 Friends episodes total
- That's approximately 86 hours of content
- Which is probably less time than you've already spent watching Friends
- No judgment though - we're here to enable you

## 💜 The Vibe

This webapp captures that perfect blend of:
- 90s web design (beveled borders, baby!)
- Friends nostalgia (purple and orange forever)
- Random decision making (because who has time to choose?)

## 🎯 Perfect For

- Friends superfans who can't decide which episode to rewatch
- People who miss the aesthetic of 1999 web design
- Anyone who's ever said "Could I BE any more..."
- Nostalgia enthusiasts
- Procrastinators looking for a sign from the universe

But in this case, you're an episode picker. And you're doing great.

**Now go watch some Friends!** 📺
